# Responsive Portfolio

## The Goal

Create a portfolio website from scratch, using bootstrap, that imitates provided example and uses responsive design.

## What I've Done

Imitated examples to the best of my ability. Created the About Me, Portfolio, and Contact pages. 

Included required personal info, semantic elements, media-queries. Portfolio images resize depending on window width.

Bonus: Added a sticky footer with a link back to the repo and a modal on the contact page!

## Usage

[Deployed Website](https://arhamilton92.github.io/responsive-portfolio/)

Scroll through the various pages and test how they react to different window sizes!
